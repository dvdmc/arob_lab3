# Laboratory 3

The repository contains an Docker description and files required for the laboratory 3 in the course of Autonomous Robots at the Universidad de Zaragoza.

## Instructions

To run the Docker you can just execute:

```
xhost + # this will enable gazebo visualization
docker compose up -d # use the -d for keep the container alive in background
```

The image will build if it is not already built. Then, an instance of the container is running now with the display configuration set and the directory `p00_arob_lab3_drones` mounted on `/root/catkin_ws/src/p00_arob_lab3_drones`. Now you can run as many terminals as needed with:
 ```
 docker exec -it aroblab3 /bin/bash
 ```

We don't recommend running more than one terminal but rather start a `tmux` session with:

 ```
 tmux new -t arob2
 ```
 
 This terminal server also allows multiplexation of panes as `terminator` and, additionally, session persistence (the tmux session will stay up unless you close it or stop the Docker). However, the learning curve is steeper. Here is a [cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/). For selecting text for copying, you have to keep the `shift` key pressed.

For stopping the container run on the **repo** root folder (not inside the container):
 ``` 
 xhost -
 docker compose down
 ```
 ## Instructions for the exercises

 > **!!! IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO ADD THE POSITION CONTROL IN HECTOR QUADROTOR**
 
 1. The Docker includes the `hector_quadrotor` repository so you don't have to add any dependencies. You will have to explore them with `cat`, `nano`, or `vim`. Feel free to clone it somwhere else if you want to explore it with VSCode.
 
 2. You can modify the code outside of Docker with VSCode and build/run inside the Docker. The disadvantage is that you won't have the linter with the ROS C++ libraries.
 
 > **NOTE:** If you are executing on Windows, there are different things you might have to do in the docker-compose.yml:
 > 1. Install XLaunch and configure it correctly: dissable access control (check a box) and, maybe deactivate "Native opengl" if there are problems with OpenGL inside the Docker. 
 >
 > 2. The volumes might have to be specified with global path.
 >
 > 3. Modify the following line in the docker-compose.yml:  `DISPLAY: host.docker.internal:0.0`
